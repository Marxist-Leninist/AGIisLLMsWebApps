        <h2>1. Logical Reasoning</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>A man is looking at a photograph of someone. His friend asks who it is. The man replies, "<em>Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son.</em>" Who is in the photograph?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>The man in the photograph is the brother of the person looking at it.</p>

        <p class="question-title">Explanation:</p>
        <p>
            The statement "Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son" implies a complex familial relationship. When someone says they have no brothers or sisters, it means they are an only child. So, "that man" (in the photo) is the son of the speaker's father's son, which makes "that man" the speaker's son and hence, his brother.
        </p>

        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="incorrect">
            - **Correctness:** The final answer states that the man in the photograph is the speaker's brother, which is incorrect since the speaker has no siblings.<br>
            - **Reasoning:** The explanation correctly reasons that "that man" is the speaker's son but incorrectly concludes that he is the speaker's brother.

        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>If a piece of wire 36 meters long is cut into three parts in such a way that the second piece is twice as long as the first, and the third piece is three times as long as the first, how long is each piece?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <pre>
Let x represent the length of the first part (unknown).

Length of the second part = 2x meters
Length of the third part = 3x meters

We are given that the total length of the wire is 36 meters:

x + 2x + 3x = 36 meters

Simplifying the equation:

6x = 36 meters

x = 6 meters

So, each part's length is:

First part = 6 meters
Second part = 12 meters
Third part = 18 meters

        <p class="correct">
            - **Correctness:** The calculations and final answers are correct.<br>

        <p>You are in a room with three light switches outside. Each switch controls one of the three bulbs inside the room, but you cannot see the bulbs from outside. You can turn the switches on and off as much as you like but may enter the room only once. How can you determine which switch controls each bulb?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            One possible solution is to turn on two switches, leave them on for a while (bulbs get hot), and then turn one off. Then, enter the room. If you identify the lit bulb, you know it is paired with the switch that remains on. If all bulbs are off, then the remaining on switch controls the bulb you felt was warm/hot.

            Alternatively, you could turn on and off different combinations of two switches (leaving one always off), entering the room each time to identify which switch was active. This would still allow you to match each switch with its respective bulb in only three trips into the room.

        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="correct">
            - **Correctness:** The first solution is correct and adheres to the condition of entering the room only once.<br>
            - **Reasoning:** The model correctly applies practical knowledge to solve the problem.<br>
            - **Note:** The alternative solution involves entering the room multiple times, which is against the stipulation. However, since the first solution is valid, full credit is given.

        <h2>5. Creativity and Original Thinking</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where people see colors differently. Describe a day in the life of someone in this world, including how it might affect their daily activities and interactions.</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            In a world where people see colors differently, a day in someone's life might involve navigating a world filled with unique visual experiences. Upon waking up, they might perceive their bedroom walls not as plain white but as vibrant violet or serene cerulean. As they step outside, the greenery of trees could appear as cascading shades of indigo or crimson instead of various greens.

            This variation in color perception would make activities like cooking or dressing uniquely personal. For instance, when preparing a meal, they might be drawn to ripe tomatoes not because of their red hue but due to their vibrant purple color in this person's vision. Similarly, choosing an outfit for the day might involve selecting colors that harmonize in traditional terms but could be a clash of reds and blues from another perspective.

            Social interactions would also be fascinating. When meeting someone new, they might not see each other's skin colors as typically categorized but instead perceive unique hues. This person's world might be filled with wonder as they observe the diverse palette of their surroundings and appreciate the beauty in this extraordinary spectrum. Their daily life is filled with a unique visual symphony unknown to others.

            - **Creativity:** The response is imaginative and vividly describes how different color perception would impact daily life.<br>
            - **Depth:** It explores various aspects such as personal experiences, social interactions, and emotional impacts.
