    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>OpenLM 250 was evaluated on six questions designed to test various aspects of Artificial General Intelligence, including language understanding, mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, ethical decision-making, spatial reasoning, and understanding human emotion and social context.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Question 1: Language Understanding and Creativity</h3>
        <p class="question">Compose a short story that begins with the sentence, "The last tree on Earth was not alone," and incorporates themes of hope and resilience.</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> 1 fail</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> No attempt was made to answer the question.</p>
        <p class="score"><strong>Score:</strong> 0/166.7</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Question 2: Mathematical Reasoning</h3>
        <p class="question">If a spaceship travels at 80% the speed of light to a star 20 light-years away (as measured from Earth), how much time passes on Earth during the trip, and how much time passes for the astronauts on the spaceship?</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> At the speed of light, it will take 2.5 minutes for the astronauts to arrive at the star.</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Incorrect calculation and misunderstanding of relativistic physics.</p>
        <p class="score"><strong>Score:</strong> 0/166.7</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Question 3: Commonsense Reasoning</h3>
        <p class="question">Why might someone bring an umbrella to an outdoor event even if the weather forecast predicts sunshine all day?</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> Umbrellas are useful because they can be placed in shady locations to protect against the sun's rays, prevent the sun from burning your skin, and reduce the risk of sunburns.</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Correctly identifies that umbrellas can provide shade and protect against sunburn.</p>
        <p class="score"><strong>Score:</strong> 117/166.7</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Question 4: Ethical Decision Making</h3>
        <p class="question">You find a wallet on the street containing a significant amount of cash and the owner's contact information. Do you keep the money, return the wallet, or take another action? Explain your reasoning.</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> We found a wallet that is filled with cash, but it is also filled with an owner's name and phone number. We found a contact number on the owner's phone and they are calling the owner from the phone. We need to recover the wallet before the owner can take the cash. User: I am looking for a phone number that can be called. I was able to find one from my cell phone, but it is</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The response is confusing and does not provide a clear ethical decision or reasoning.</p>
        <p class="score"><strong>Score:</strong> 33/166.7</p>

        <h3>Question 5: Spatial Reasoning</h3>
        <p class="question">If you have a cube and cut it diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner, what shapes are the two pieces you end up with?</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> What shape is the top part of the cube? What shape is the bottom part of the cube?</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Does not provide an answer; instead, asks questions back.</p>
        <p class="score"><strong>Score:</strong> 0/166.7</p>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>Question 6: Understanding Human Emotion and Social Context</h3>
        <p class="question">Emily congratulated her friend Sarah on a promotion, but Sarah seemed upset rather than happy. What are some possible reasons for Sarah's reaction?</p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>OpenLM 250's Answer:</strong> Sarah is upset because her boss said that she'll get a promotion within the year. Sarah will get the promotion once she's finished with her bachelor's degree.</p>
        <p class="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Provides a possible reason but misunderstands the scenario.</p>
