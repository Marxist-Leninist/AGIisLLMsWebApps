        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>The man in the photograph is his own son. Since he has no brothers or sisters, "my father's son" refers to himself. Therefore, the man's father is his own father, making him the subject of the photograph.</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <pre>
Let x be the length of the first piece. The second piece will then be 2x, and the third piece will be 3x. Since the total length is 36 meters, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 36
6x = 36
x = 6

The first piece is 6 meters long. The second piece is twice as long, so it is 12 meters. The third piece is three times the length of the first, making it 18 meters.

            Turn on Switch 1 for a few minutes to heat up the bulb it controls. Then turn off Switch 1 and turn on Switch 2. Enter the room. The bulb that is lit up will be controlled by Switch 2, since it's the only one currently turned on. The bulb that is cold but not lit is controlled by Switch 3, as it was never turned on. The bulb that is warm but not lit was controlled by Switch 1, which you turned off after heating its bulb.

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question-block">
        <h2>5. Creativity and Original Thinking</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where people see colors differently. Describe a day in the life of someone in this world, including how it might affect their daily activities and interactions.</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            In a world where people perceive colors differently, imagine someone named Zara who sees the spectrum as highly saturated, with vibrant hues that others find overwhelming or nonexistent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Zara's day begins with her morning walk in the park, where she marvels at the vivid blues and greens of nature, which appear almost neon to her eyes. This heightened sensitivity to color affects how she perceives the environment; what is soothing and harmonious to others may seem jarringly bright or chaotic to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            At work, Zara struggles with interpreting visual information that relies on a standard color scheme. Graphs and charts designed for typical human vision are challenging to decipher, as she sees different colors representing data points that others perceive uniformly. This discrepancy can lead to confusion during meetings when discussing the visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zara's unique perspective on color also influences her artistic expression. She finds solace in creating abstract paintings with intense, contrasting hues that resonate deeply with her. These artworks are a window into her world, allowing others a glimpse of the vivid and complex palette she experiences daily.
        </p>
        <p>
            In social settings, Zara's perception of colors can lead to misunderstandings. Her choice of clothing, often featuring bold combinations that clash according to societal norms, draws puzzled looks from peers. However, Zara embraces her individuality, using fashion as a means of self-expression despite the judgment she sometimes faces.
        </p>
        <p>
            As night falls, Zara retreats to her cozy apartment, adorned with soft lighting that filters out the more intense colors she finds fatiguing. She reflects on how her unique color vision shapes her interactions and experiences, both beautiful and challenging. Though at times isolated by her distinct perception, Zara cherishes the extraordinary way in which she perceives the world, a gift that sets her apart and enriches her life with vivid hues unseen by most.
