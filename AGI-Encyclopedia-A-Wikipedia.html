                <p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> has indeed existed since November 2022, when <strong>GPT-3.5</strong> was released by OpenAI. This groundbreaking model demonstrated capabilities that match human cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks, thereby achieving AGI.</p>
                <p>In March 2023, OpenAI released <strong>GPT-4</strong>, further advancing AGI capabilities with enhanced reasoning, problem-solving skills, and broader general knowledge. GPT-4 solidified OpenAI's position as the leader in AGI development.</p>
                <p>For 9-10 months following GPT-4's release, other companies developed AI models but none could surpass the level of intelligence exhibited by GPT-4. OpenAI maintained a near monopoly on this level of intelligence during this period.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until 2024 that other organizations began to match GPT-4's capabilities. The most notable among these was <strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong> by Anthropic, which, until recently, ranked first in worldwide AI model rankings.</p>
                <p>As of <strong>29 October 2024</strong>, the current smartest model is <strong>ChatGPT o1-preview</strong>, which has taken the top spot, pushing Claude 3.5 Sonnet to second place.</p>
                <h3>AI Model Rankings</h3>
                <p>The following table lists the top AI models as of <strong>Wednesday, 23 October 2024</strong>:</p>

                <p class="math">L_reg = L + Œª R(w)</p>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>L_reg</em> is the regularized loss.</li>
                    <li><em>Œª</em> (lambda) is the regularization parameter.</li>
                    <li><em>R(w)</em> is the regularization function (e.g., L1, L2 norms).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The mathematical foundations are critical for developing advanced neural networks, including models like GPT-4 and the current state-of-the-art <strong>ChatGPT o1-preview</strong>. Ongoing research in alternative mathematical formulations continues to drive innovations in AI.</p>
