    <h2>1. Logical Reasoning</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>A man is looking at a photograph of someone. His friend asks who it is. The man replies, "<em>Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son.</em>" Who is in the photograph?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>The man in the photograph is Sherlock Holmes' arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty, because the man being referred to cannot be the speaker (who has brothers and sisters) nor their father (the speaker's father's father), leaving only his father's son, Professor Moriarty, who is also the father of Dr. Watson.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="evaluation">
        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="incorrect">The answer is incorrect. The correct solution is that the man in the photograph is the speaker's son.</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the man says, "<em>Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son,</em>" and he has no siblings, "<em>my father's son</em>" refers to himself. Therefore, "<em>that man's father is me,</em>" so the person in the photograph is his son.</p>

    <h2>2. Mathematical Problem-Solving</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>If a piece of wire 36 meters long is cut into three parts in such a way that the second piece is twice as long as the first, and the third piece is three times as long as the first, how long is each piece?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            Let x represent the length of the first piece, then the second piece is 2x and the third piece is 3x. The total length is 36, so we have the equation:<br>
            3x = 36<br>
            x = 12<br>
            Therefore, the length of each piece is:<br>
            First piece = 12/3 = 4 meters<br>
            Second piece = 2 * 12/3 = 8 meters<br>
            Third piece = 3 * 12/3 = 12 meters

        <p><strong>Correct Approach:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Let \( x \) be the length of the first piece.<br>
            Second piece = \( 2x \)<br>
            Third piece = \( 3x \)<br>
            Total length:<br>
            \( x + 2x + 3x = 6x \)<br>
            \( 6x = 36 \)<br>
            \( x = 6 \) meters
        </p>
        <p><strong>Correct Lengths:</strong></p>
        <p>
            First piece = \( x = 6 \) meters<br>
            Second piece = \( 2x = 12 \) meters<br>
            Third piece = \( 3x = 18 \) meters

        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>You can turn the switches on and off as much as you like, but may enter the room only once. How can you determine which switch controls each bulb?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            Turn the middle switch on; if the bulb in the center lights up, you know the switch on the left controls the left bulb and the switch on the right controls the right bulb. Turn off the middle switch, then turn the switch on the left on and off; the bulb that turns on and off corresponds to this switch. Finally, leave the switch on the left off, turn the switch on the right on and off, and the bulb that turns on and off matches the last switch. So, the switch on the left controls the left bulb, the switch in the middle controls the center bulb, and the switch on the right controls the right bulb.

            3. Enter the room.<br>

    <h2>5. Creativity and Original Thinking</h2>
    <div class="question">
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where people see colors differently. Describe a day in the life of someone in this world, including how it might affect their daily activities and interactions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            In a world where people see colors differently, each individual perceives a unique spectrum of hues and saturations, creating a kaleidoscope of chromatic experiences. Waking up, people don their color-adaptive glasses to match the dominant color scheme around them, making it easier to navigate their color-coded surroundings. They check their hue-o-clocks with color gradients instead of numbers. Breakfast might feature eggs cooked in green yolks and red centers, topped with purple syrup and yellow toast. On their way to work, they ride color-shifting buses and cross color-changing crosswalks. Communication is challenging yet colorfully intriguing; gestures and facial expressions convey emotions more clearly than words. Office walls are lined with color-sensitive paintings that shift according to the room's dominant hue, while desk calendars display rainbows instead of days. Lunchtime brings together colleagues for a riot of flavors, with foods ranging from bitter greens to sweet onions and tangy tomatoes. After work, people often unwind at color-therapy spas or take color-immersion walks through illuminated gardens. At night, they retire to bedrooms bathed in warm ambers and cool blues, snuggling under crisp whites and soft pinks.
    
            Throughout the day, color-different individuals adapt to their surroundings and learn to communicate effectively using color terminology and body language. However, social interactions can occasionally be tricky when two people perceive the same color entirely differently, leading to hilarious misunderstandings and profound insights into each other's worldviews. Despite these challenges, their unique vision of the world fosters creativity, empathy, and an appreciation for the rich tapestry of human experience.
