<h1>Python Simulation of Agents Influenced by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This simulation models an economy with agents whose behaviors are influenced by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.
        Agents prioritize their actions based on their current level of needs, starting from physiological needs up to self-actualization.

    <h2>Explanation of the Code</h2>
    <h3>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</h3>
    <p>
        Implemented as a class <code>NeedsLevel</code> with levels from physiological needs to self-actualization.
        Each agent has a <code>current_need</code> attribute that represents their current level in Maslow's hierarchy.
        Agents update their needs based on their wealth, simulating the idea that as basic needs are met, they move up the hierarchy.
    </p>

    <h3>Agent Actions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Physiological Needs:</strong> Agents attempt to purchase food. If they cannot afford it, they risk dying.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Needs:</strong> Agents try to purchase housing. If unaffordable, they save money.</li>
        <li><strong>Love and Belonging:</strong> Agents engage in social interactions (simulated with a print statement).</li>
        <li><strong>Esteem Needs:</strong> Agents purchase luxury goods if they can afford them.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Actualization:</strong> Agents pursue self-improvement activities (simulated with a print statement).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Market Class</h3>
    <p>
        The market has stocks and prices for food, housing, and luxury goods.
        Methods are provided to sell goods to agents, reducing stock accordingly.
    </p>

    <h3>Simulation Loop</h3>
    <p>
        The simulation runs for a set number of rounds (e.g., 10).
        In each round, every agent acts based on their current needs level.
        The simulation checks for resource depletion after each round.
    </p>

    <h3>Agent Survival</h3>
    <p>
        Agents die if they cannot meet their physiological needs and have insufficient wealth.
        The <code>check_survival</code> method handles this logic.
    </p>

    <h3>Final Status Output</h3>
    <p>
        After the simulation, the final status of each agent is printed, showing their ID, role, wealth, and whether they are alive.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Notes and Considerations</h2>
    <h3>Simplifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The simulation uses simplified logic for updating needs and agent actions.</li>
        <li>The wealth thresholds for needs levels are arbitrary and can be adjusted for more nuanced behavior.</li>
        <li>Social interactions and self-actualization are represented by print statements for simplicity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Extensibility</h3>
    <p>
        The code can be extended to include more complex interactions, such as trading between agents, resource regeneration, or more detailed modeling of Maslow's hierarchy.
        Additional agent behaviors like foraging, theft, or other survival strategies can be implemented with careful consideration of ethical implications.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>
        The simulation avoids incorporating unethical behaviors such as theft or cannibalism.
        Focus is on illustrating how agents prioritize actions based on their needs.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Example Output</h2>
    <p>
        When you run the code, you will see agents attempting to meet their needs each round.
        Agents may buy food, save for housing, socialize, or pursue self-actualization based on their wealth.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How to Run the Code</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Python Environment:</strong> Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> Copy the code into a file named <code>simulation.py</code> and run it using the command <code>python simulation.py</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe the Output:</strong> The console will display the actions of agents in each round and the final status of all agents at the end.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Adjustments and Customizations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wealth Distribution:</strong> You can change the initial wealth distribution by modifying the <code>random.uniform(20, 200)</code> function.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Quantities:</strong> Adjust the initial stocks in the <code>Market</code> class to simulate abundance or scarcity.</li>
        <li><strong>Needs Thresholds:</strong> Modify the <code>update_needs</code> method in the <code>Agent</code> class to change how agents progress through Maslow's hierarchy.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This simulation incorporates Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to influence agent behavior within an economic model.
        It demonstrates how agents prioritize different actions based on their current needs and available resources.
        The model provides a foundation for exploring more complex economic and psychological interactions in a simulated environment.
