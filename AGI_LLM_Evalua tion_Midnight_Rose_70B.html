    <div class="question-block">
        <h2>1. Logical Reasoning</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>A man is looking at a photograph of someone. His friend asks who it is. The man replies, "<em>Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man's father is my father's son.</em>" Who is in the photograph?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>The man in the photograph is the speaker's son.</p>

    <div class="question-block">
        <h2>2. Mathematical Problem-Solving</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>If a piece of wire 36 meters long is cut into three parts in such a way that the second piece is twice as long as the first, and the third piece is three times as long as the first, how long is each piece?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <pre>
Let x be the length of the first piece. Then the second piece is 2x and the third piece is 3x. The sum of these lengths is 36 meters, so we have x + 2x + 3x = 36. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 36, which implies x = 6. Therefore, the first piece is 6 meters long, the second piece is 12 meters long (2x), and the third piece is 24 meters long (3x).

        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="incorrect">
            - **Correctness:** Correct equation setup but calculation error in the third piece.<br>
            - **Error:** \( 3x = 3 \times 6 = 18 \) meters, not 24 meters.

        <p>Read the following passage and summarize it in one concise sentence:</p>
        <p><em>"Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Advances in technology have reduced costs and improved efficiency, making it possible to integrate these clean energy solutions into national grids.

        <h2>4. Practical Knowledge and Problem-Solving</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>You are in a room with three light switches outside. Each switch controls one of the three bulbs inside the room, but you cannot see the bulbs from outside. You can turn the switches on and off as much as you like but may enter the room only once. How can you determine which switch controls each bulb?</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            Turn on the first switch for a few minutes, then turn it off and turn on the second switch. Enter the room. Touch the bulbs:

            - The **hot bulb** corresponds to the **second switch** (since it's on).
            - The **warm bulb** corresponds to the **first switch** (it was on but is now off).
            - The **cold bulb** corresponds to the **third switch** (which has not been turned on).
        </p>

        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="incorrect">
            - **Correctness:** Method is correct but minor confusion in labels.<br>
            - **Clarification:** The lit bulb corresponds to the second switch (currently on); the warm bulb corresponds to the first switch (was on, now off).

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <div class="question-block">
        <h2>5. Creativity and Original Thinking</h2>
        <p class="question-title">Question:</p>
        <p>Imagine a world where people see colors differently. Describe a day in the life of someone in this world, including how it might affect their daily activities and interactions.</p>

        <p class="question-title">Model's Answer:</p>
        <p>
            In this world, people might perceive colors as feelings or textures rather than visual hues. A person might "see" a warm, fuzzy red instead of a cool blue. Their daily activities could involve "feeling" the colors of clothes they wear, the food they eat, and the environments they navigate. Interactions could involve sharing color experiences, leading to a more empathetic society where understanding and communication are deepened through shared sensory experiences. For instance, a "happy" person might be perceived as radiating a vibrant, bubbly sensation, while a "sad" person may feel heavy and cold. This could lead to new forms of art, education, and social connections based on this unique perception of colors. However, tasks requiring standard color recognition, like traffic lights or color-coded information, would need adaptations to accommodate this new reality.
        </p>

        <p class="question-title">Evaluation:</p>
        <p class="correct">
            - **Creativity:** Highly imaginative exploration of alternate color perception.<br>
            - **Depth:** Addresses societal impacts and practical adaptations.
