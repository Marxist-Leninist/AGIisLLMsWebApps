<h1>Part 2: Extending the Semi-Universal, Fully Analytical RCS Solution</h1>

<p>
In this continuation, we show another illustrative example and restate what we’ve achieved, as well as what remains solved and unsolved. We again focus on the semi-universal, fully analytical framework that combines exact known blocks and distribution-based random blocks to produce a single analytical formula.
</p>

<h2>Recap of the Approach</h2>

<p>
We have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exact Small/Special Cases (Solved):</strong> Fully understood and have closed-form solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Approximate Special Regimes (Solved):</strong> Statistical distributions like Beta, Dirichlet, or Porter-Thomas give us closed-form probability densities for random-like segments.</li>
  <li><strong>Semi-Universal, Fully Analytical Method (Solved):</strong> By combining exact sub-block amplitudes with integrals over known probability distributions, we create a fully analytical integral expression that applies to a broad (but not universal) class of circuits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Still, <strong>Fully Universal Solutions (Unsolved):</strong> No single closed-form formula covers all large, arbitrary random circuits in a simple manner.
</p>

<h2>Another Demonstration (Part 2)</h2>

<p>
This time, let's imagine:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>An exact sub-block $U_{\text{exact}}$ that’s a known two-qubit gate (e.g., a simple 2-qubit gate like a controlled-Z) for which we know the action exactly.</li>
  <li>A random block $U_{\text{random}}$ that is approximated by a two-qubit Dirichlet distribution for its amplitudes. For simplicity, let’s assume it has a Dirichlet(1,1,1,1) distribution for the four amplitudes corresponding to $|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle$ outputs. This is a uniform distribution over the 3-simplex.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The amplitude we want is still:
</p>

<div class="equation">
  $$ \langle x|U|0\rangle = \sum_z \langle x|U_{\text{random}}|z\rangle \langle z|U_{\text{exact}}|0\rangle. $$
</div>

<p>
For two qubits, $z$ and $x$ each range over $\{00,01,10,11\}$. Suppose $U_{\text{exact}}$ is known (e.g., a CZ gate acting after some small known rotation), so we can write down $\langle z|U_{\text{exact}}|0\rangle$ directly.
</p>

<p>
$U_{\text{random}}$ amplitudes $(p_{00}, p_{01}, p_{10}, p_{11})$ follow Dirichlet(1,1,1,1), whose PDF is:
</p>

<div class="equation">
  $$ f(p_{00}, p_{01}, p_{10}, p_{11}) = 6 \quad \text{for } p_{00}+p_{01}+p_{10}+p_{11}=1, p_i \geq 0. $$
</div>

<p>
Then:
</p>

<div class="equation">
  $$ \langle x|U|0\rangle = \int_{\text{simplex}} \left(\sum_z \langle z|U_{\text{exact}}|0\rangle p_z\right) 6 \, dp_{00}dp_{01}dp_{10}dp_{11}, $$
</div>

<p>
Here $p_z$ are the random block amplitudes, integrated over the uniform simplex. All functions are known, and $U_{\text{exact}}$ gives exact coefficients.
</p>

<p>
This integral is fully analytical. For certain choices of $U_{\text{exact}}$, we can even solve it exactly to get a closed-form expectation value.

// In this simplified code demo, we won't fully implement a 2-qubit Dirichlet integral.
// Instead, we'll simulate a scenario and show that we know the PDF exactly and can in principle integrate.

// Let's say U_exact acts on |00> → a_known, |01> → b_known, |10> → c_known, |11> → d_known (just some known complex numbers):
const a_known = {re: 0.7, im: 0}; 
const b_known = {re: 0.3, im: 0};
const c_known = {re: 0.2, im: 0};
const d_known = {re: 0.6, im: 0};

// For Dirichlet(1,1,1,1), the expected value of each p_z is 1/4.
// If we want the expectation of sum_z p_z * (amplitude_z), it's just the average of the amplitudes, since all p_z are symmetric and their average is 1/4 each.

function runDemo2() {
  // The expected amplitude given the uniform distribution on the simplex is:
  // E(p_z) = 1/4 for each z.
  // So, E( sum_z p_z * amplitude_z ) = (amplitude_00 + amplitude_01 + amplitude_10 + amplitude_11)/4

  const sumRe = a_known.re + b_known.re + c_known.re + d_known.re;
  const avgRe = sumRe/4;

  // This is the "semi-universal" analytical solution: 
  // We didn't need to numerically integrate because we know the Dirichlet(1,1,1,1) distribution's symmetry.
  // In a more complicated scenario, we'd perform the integral or use known formulas for Dirichlet integrals.

<h2>What Remains Solved and Unsolved</h2>

<p><strong>Solved:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Exact small/special circuits: Fully solved, closed-form solutions available.</li>
  <li>Approximate special regimes: Solved via known statistical distributions, providing closed-form PDFs.</li>
  <li>Semi-universal, fully analytical combinations: Solved. We can combine exact and approximate pieces into integral formulas that are closed-form integrals of known distributions and functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unsolved:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully universal exact solution for any large, arbitrary random circuit: Remains unsolved. No known simple closed-form formula handles all cases.</li>
  <li>Fully universal approximate formula that’s both simple and applies to all random circuits: Also unsolved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
In Part 2, we reinforced the concept with another example, using a 2-qubit scenario and a Dirichlet distribution. This again shows that while we cannot solve everything universally, the semi-universal approach provides a substantial analytical handle on many interesting cases. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, we have made significant progress:  
- We started from isolated exact and approximate solutions.  
- We developed a methodology to combine them.  
- We obtained a semi-universal, fully analytical integral representation that applies to a broad class of circuits, even if not all.
